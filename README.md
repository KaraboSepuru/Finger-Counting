# Finger-Counting
Count the number of fingers on a colour image of a cropped hand. Your output should be the number of fingers held up

# Introduction
Finger counting, also known as finger detection or hand gesture recognition, plays a vital role in various human-computer interaction applications. The ability to accurately count the number of fingers held up in a hand image has practical significance in fields
such as virtual reality, robotics, and sign language interpretation. We aim to develop a robust and efficient solution for finger counting by utilizing non-learning-based image processing techniques. 

This project focuses on applying non-learning techniques to count the number of fingers in a color image of a cropped hand. We explore using digital image processing algorithms and methods to detect and quantify the fingers held up in the hand image. We aim to develop an effective solution that can handle varying hand orientations, shapes, and sizes by leveraging image enhancement, segmentation, and contour analysis techniques.
